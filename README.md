# PyBer Analysis
Analysis for PyBer Ride Sharing App

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis and creating visualizations on PyBer's ride sharing data to help improve access to rideshare services and determine affordability for underserved areas. Using Python and Pandas, a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type is created. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type is created.

## Results

Going through the charts and tables, it is clear that urban cities have the most number of rides, followed by suburban and rural. However, what is interesting is the fare charged by drivers in each city. Even through rural cities have the fewest number of rides, rural city drivers charge the highest fares as seen in the image below.

This data clearly shows the following:
- Urban cities have the largest number of PyBer drivers and users.
- Drivers in rural cities are earning more than drivers in urban cities.
- The costs for using PyBer's ridesharing service is greater for riders in rural cities than users in urban cities.
